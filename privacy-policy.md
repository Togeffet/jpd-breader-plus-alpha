JPD-Breader Plus Alpha Privacy Policy

This extension collects no data of its own and only acts as a messenger between the user (you) and jpdb.io. All communications between you and jpdb are communicated securely over https and not stored anywhere. Due to the fact that your data is being communicated to-and-from jpdb (which remains closed-source), your data may be being processed and stored by them. As you have a jpdb account, you are beholden to their privacy policy (available here: https://jpdb.io/privacy-policy) but this extension is completely unrelated to jpdb.io and made unofficially to work with their public API.

This extension will remain open source so all code may be looked at and scrutinized at any time.
